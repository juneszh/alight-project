## Requirements
PHP 7.4+

## Usage
```bash
$ composer create-project juneszh/alight-project {PROJECT_DIRECTORY}
```

## Directory Structure
* `app/` *Contains the core code of your application.*
    * `Controllers/` *Contains controllers that handle requests (MVC pattern).*
    * `Jobs/` *Contains jobs run by the time-based scheduler.*
    * `Models/` *Contains models of database (MVC pattern).*
    * `Services/` *Contains the business logics.*
    * `Views/` *Contains views with page templates (MVC pattern).*
    * `bootstrap.php` *The web bootstraps.*
    * `scheduler.php` *Job scheduler run by CRON.*
* `config/` *Contains all of application's configuration files.*
    * `admin/` *Contains the admin's menu and console configuration.*
    * `routes/` *Contains the route's configuration.*
    * `app.php` *Application's configuration.*
    * `job.php` *Job scheduler's configuration.*
* `public/` *Contains the index.php file and assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.*
    * `favicon.ico` *Icon for the web application.*
    * `index.php` *Entry point for all requests entering the web application.*
* `storage/` *Contains logs, route caches, file caches, and other files generated by the framework.*
* `vendor/` *Contains composer dependencies.*

## Shortcut Namespaces
The classes in the application are always called from the business code, so we define some shortcut namespaces to improve coding efficiency.
| Namespace | Directory |
| -- | -- |
| `ctr` | `app/Controllers` |
| `job` | `app/Jobs` |
| `mod` | `app/Models` |
| `svc` | `app/Services` |

For example:
```php
// The route handler points to function 'index' in app/Controllers/Pages.php
Alight\Route::get('/', [\ctr\Pages::class, 'index']);
```

## Composer Scripts
The admin panel is not built by default when creating project, you need to do it with composer scripts:
```bash
$ composer require juneszh/alight-admin
$ composer run-script admin-install
```
List of scripts:
| Name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `admin-install` | Initialize the runtime environment required by the [Alight-Admin](https://github.com/juneszh/alight-admin). |
| `admin-download` | Download the admin panel front-end resources from [Alight-Admin releases](https://github.com/juneszh/alight-admin/releases) and override.|
| `admin-build` | Rebuild the admin panel front-end resources by npm packages. ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) required) |
