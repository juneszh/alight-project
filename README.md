## Shortcut namespaces
The classes in the application are always called from the business code, so we define some shortcut namespaces to improve coding efficiency.
| Namespace | Directory |
| -- | -- |
| `ctr\` | `app/Controllers` |
| `job\` | `app/Jobs` |
| `mod\` | `app/Models` |
| `svc\` | `app/Services` |

For example:
```php
// The route handler points to function 'index' in app/Controllers/Pages.php
Alight\Route::get('/', [\ctr\Pages::class, 'index']);
```
